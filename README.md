# Website for Vytautas Bucionis 
## DCART 498 Project by Mollika Chakraborty and Alexander MacKinnon

### Project description 

This project aimed to create an inclusive website accessible to individuals with disabilities, with a primary focus on blind users. By adhering to design guidelines and leveraging accessibility technologies like screen readers, we ensured smooth navigation and usability. Primarily we used WordPress for the developement of the website as it gives some backend hep to begin with and incorporated automation procedures using application like Zapier.Training our client to the WordPress environment and create small changes liek making a post, changing the dates, etc. empowered them to manage content independently. However, few more adjuustments are due regarding the challenges like choosing a hosting service and being able to upload larger media files, prompting adjustments to improve accessibility on the developement end of the process where Vytautas can edit content anytime hasslefree. Through close collaboration and learning from our client's experiences, we gained insights into effective design practices and the importance of inclusivity. This project not only provided valuable learning opportunities but also sparked a shift in our approach towards empathetic and user-centered design.
